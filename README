C++ game framework based on Flixel library (by Adam Atomic). Framework is still not finished and may contain many bugs. Keep in mind that it's not 1:1 port of Flixel. My library has some differences in API and rendering system.

What is currently ported?
- State managment based on FlxState class
- Creating new types of entities based on overriding FlxBasic and FlxObject classes.
- Grouping entities by FlxGroup class.
- Displaying sprites and animations by FlxSprite class
- Text rendering via FlxText
- Basic collisions
- Playing sounds and music (may contain bugs)
- Tilemaps

What isn't ported yet
- Particles system
- Saves
- Camera managment
- Buttons

What isn't ported and probably will never be.
- Replays
- Pathfinding
- Physics
- QuadTrees

The biggest advantage of my framework is that the backend part is tottaly separated from the Flixel API. We could write our own window managment/input/rendering/sounding classes by simply overriding FlxBackendBase class. Default built-in PC backend is SFML system. 
This makes my framework portable through all popular devices with no API changes.
